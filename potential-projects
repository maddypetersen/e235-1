#### Who are you?
God
#### As best you can, describe the field or industry you can see yourself working in as a technical writer.
I want to be a graphic designer/freelance artist. 
#### What genres of documents/texts do technical writers in this field produce? What do these look like?Locate and share, if possible, some samples or examples of this genre. (If you're unclear on the term genre -- no worries. Look it up and we'll discuss it.)
I will be writing contracts and artist statements
#### What genre of technical writing do you have sense you might want to practice explore? If different from above, what do these look like? Locate and share, if possible, some samples or examples of this genre.
Contract writing. I have to write a contract to give to clients that explain what I do and what they are paying for. I have never written a contract before. I feel like I would forget something important and that would be turned against me later.
#### What sorts of research tend to be associated with these genres? At this point, do you know the difference between quantitative and qualitative research? If not, no worries -- look it up.
I can research other artists contracts and how they write and format and what they include.
#### Another way to approach this project is to think situationally. What situations do technical writers in your desired field tend to be responding to? How might we replicate this situation in the context of our class?
Contracts for my clients who want my skills in art. An artisit statement is a few sentences explaining your thought process and why you made that art. Its suppossed to be unprofessional and creative.
#### Beyond your desired field or industry, what situtaions -- professional, academic, even personal -- are you currently involved in that might need the work of a technical writer? For example, maybe your job doesn't have an employee manual, but really is in need of one. Or, maybe there is a manual but its 25 years old.
I need to write a contract for my clients who want my art
#### Given your responses to the above prompts -- what do you think? what are some possibilities for projects?
Contract writing could be helpful for me and a lot of other artists/designers
